This project was my first foray into objective-c programming and developing for iOS without the framework of a games engine to rely on for core setup. I found the language pretty interesting but in honesty haven't used it for many for projects since, favouring more universal platform solutions. 

I also used this project to focus on increasing my experience and knowledge regarding hardware restrictions and optimisations. One example of this in the above is a low-pass filter on gyro readings I implemented, allowing me to reduce the refresh rate and optimise my app for limited mobile battery life.
