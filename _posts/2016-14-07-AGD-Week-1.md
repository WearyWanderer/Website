Now that I'm back at university for the year, our AGD (Advanced Games Development) module has kicked in to full swing! In this module I'm working with a large team (13 people) on a single product for the final ICA submission. It's totally open ended and working with designers, artsist, modellers & animators to create a functioning and *hopefully* professional quality game prototype is an extremely exciting prospect.

When we first started meeting as a team we really quickly began building some synergy between everyone, and already had a core concept for a game in place from week 1. We're aiming to create a tight, short demo level for a 3D platformer game. It's inspired by the likes of Mario 64, Ratchet & Clank and Yooka Laylee, while we're putting a string emphasis on making sure that the entire package feels **incredibly** well thought through and put together, with the product's strength being the quality at finish rather than a USP mechanic never seen in other games.

From the get-go I pushed the idea of focusing and the most prevalent interactions in-game in the intial weeks. It almost goes without saying that a 3D open-level platformer with poor movement controls or choppy, tough to control or even a *shudders* static camera is going to have a rough time engaging it's players. 

The designers were eager to begin rough test concepts for the camera controls, while I highlighted my key priorities when implementing to them. First and foremost, I wanted to ensure that the camera never restricted level design or forced the player into a particular position, so freedom was key. Along with this, itâ€™s generally a good polishing touch in a 3D game to have some camera collision to prevent wall clipping.

As our team were set on a platformer, I looked to other modern platformers for inspiration and research.
