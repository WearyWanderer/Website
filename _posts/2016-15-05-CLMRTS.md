In the final four weeks on my second year at University, myself and four other programming students came together as a team in the Game Jam module to produce a prototype level/demo for a game of our own design, using the Unity engine.

The end result of these several weeks was CLMRTS (Competitive Lane-Management & Real Time Strategy - quite the mouthful and obviously a placeholder!), an 'Anti-MOBA' of sorts, taking inspiration from Warcraft 3 custom maps like <i>Footman Wars</i>. Our prototype was considered realtively feature rich by the end,
and was playable enough to have recieved some insightful and positive feedback from testers. 

CLMRTS managed to receive several of the awards given at the post-module playtesting ceremony, including the 'Best Overall Team' award, an achievement we are all proud of.
