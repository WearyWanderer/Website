For my final year project at Teesside University, I wanted to do something a little more focused on game development rather than simple a game prototype/demonstration. As I wanted to demonstrate my project at ExpoTees (TODO - Link here), I wanted to create something with a real world benefit to games studios.

After having a great time completing the standford university machine learning course on Coursera (TODO - another link), I was really eager to do *something* with machine learning in a games engine. It took a lot of time watching various machine learning videos on games as well as drafting ideas before coming to something that I felt was achievable in the time given on our course while still meeting my ambitions, but my final project can be summarised a little like this:
