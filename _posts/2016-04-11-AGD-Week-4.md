Week four started to see an interactive product come together and so I began work on scripts that would allow designers a modular approach to modifying existing prefabs when designing level sections. This week, I worked on generic scripts that would allow an object to float on any given axis with adjustable speeds and distances. This component was simple to create, so I then built upon the concept by implementing a check which halts the objects movement **only** when collision with the player occurs in the axis of movement specified, in a MovingPlatform class, as this feature is specific to moving objects that the player will use as surfaces.

The method of checking the angle of direction is implemented by using the global hit direction of a raycast generated from the collision, and checking this against the member variable for the movement axis -
{% highlight csharp %}
void OnCollisionEnter(Collision collision)
{

	RaycastHit hit;
	Vector3 direction = (transform.position - collision.gameObject.transform.position).normalized;
	Ray ray = new Ray(collision.gameObject.transform.position, direction);

	if (Physics.Raycast(ray, out hit))
	{

		if (hit.collider != null)
		{
			Vector3 normal = hit.normal;
			normal = hit.transform.TransformDirection(normal);

			switch (moveAxis)
			{
				case MoveAxis.X_AXIS:
					if (normal == hit.transform.right || normal == -hit.transform.right) { m_isColliding = true; }
					break;
				case MoveAxis.Y_AXIS:
					if (normal == -hit.transform.up) { m_isColliding = true; }
					break;
				case MoveAxis.Z_AXIS:
					if (normal == hit.transform.forward || normal == -hit.transform.forward) { m_isColliding = true; }
					break;
			}
		}
	}

	
}
{% endhighlight %}

I also create a basic pickup script that would serve as the base class for any future pickups implemented. This was tested by combining it with a moving object script on a temporary object and creating simple prefabs that would eventually become the coin pickups -
