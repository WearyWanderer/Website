Continuing the focus on the most utilised mechanics in any third person platformer, in the second week I began work on the basic character movement script. The intention was to create general directional movement and some subtle other movement features in a `BasicCharacterMovement` base class, and have the advanced components such as jumping mechanics, sliding mechanics etc. in an `AdvancedCharacterMovement` script.

Some notable features of the basic character movement are -

- Joystick and WASD directional movement using Rigidbody physics. The characters forward direction is taken for the normaslised forward direction of the camera.
- A subtle acceleration and decelleration on starting movement and stopping, as well as movement speed thresholding to the amount the joystick is pushed.
- A halting coroutine when the sudden change in direction is over a maximum degree threshold (imitating the realistic movement of turning on ones heel, this was inspired after playing the incredibly immersive *The Witcher 3*!)
