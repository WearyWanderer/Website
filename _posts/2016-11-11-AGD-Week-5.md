After looking at some of the subtle features in games like Super Mario 64, Jake (Lead Artist) also noted that many platformer games aimed at a varied age audience will allow control over the camera to the user, but when the camera is not being controlled will have some degree of automatic alignment, so as to not burden the player and allow them to focusing on controlling the character *if they wish*.

I have implemented camera realignment to behind the player when the camera is not being manually moved **and** the player is moving, but I am currently tackling a bug in this when the angle the camera is slerping to crosses over the -180 to 180 degree boundary that unity has in it's degree system rather than using a 0 to 360 degree range. the result is a jittery rubber banding effect between slerp left and right as the program struggles to determine which direction it should move to reach the desired angle.

(Could put a video or gif here)
