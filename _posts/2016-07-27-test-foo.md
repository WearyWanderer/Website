So this post originally just had some dumb lorem ipsum because I was trying to figure out if the hosted files on Github Pages get rebuilt or if I have to rebuild the site locally before uploading new changes - looks like it at least adds new posts, which is awesome! Not sure yet if changes to the site's css or any js will be reflected without a rebuild, but I'm still figuring out the ropes with Jekyll.

Now one thing I'd like to be able to do with my FYP work is explain some concepts using nifty visualisations. A handy tool for doing that in webpages is [D3][d3-link] which has a whole host of example interactive widgets on the landing page. Pretty sexy, right? So, this sandbox post I use for all kinds of junk is currently going to be for trying out exactly that - embedding D3 `<script>`'s or even `<iframe>`'s in a Jekyll blog post.

Test 1 (Simple D3 script):

<script src="https://d3js.org/d3.v4.min.js"></script>

<style>

.chart div {
  font: 10px sans-serif;
  background-color: steelblue;
  text-align: right;
  padding: 3px;
  margin: 1px;
  color: white;
}

</style>

<div class="chart"></div>
<script>

var data = [4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42];

var x = d3.scale.linear()
    .domain([0, d3.max(data)])
    .range([0, 420]);

d3.select(".chart")
  .selectAll("div")
    .data(data)
  .enter().append("div")
    .style("width", function(d) { return x(d) + "px"; })
    .text(function(d) { return d; });
	
</script>
