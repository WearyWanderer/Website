So this post originally just had some dumb lorem ipsum because I was trying to figure out if the hosted files on Github Pages get rebuilt or if I have to rebuild the site locally before uploading new changes - looks like it at least adds new posts, which is awesome! Not sure yet if changes to the site's css or any js will be reflected without a rebuild, but I'm still figuring out the ropes with Jekyll.

Now one thing I'd like to be able to do with my FYP work is explain some concepts using nifty visualisations. A handy tool for doing that in webpages is [D3][d3-link] which has a whole host of example interactive widgets on the landing page. Pretty sexy, right? So, this sandbox post I use for all kinds of junk is currently going to be for trying out exactly that - embedding D3 `<script>`'s or even `<iframe>`'s in a Jekyll blog post.

Test 1 (Simple D3 script):


<div id="example"></div>
<script src="https://d3js.org/d3.v4.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://raw.githack.com/WearyWanderer/wearywanderer.github.io/master/assets/js/testpost.js"></script>

Again, this is just a test page, so don't expect anything pretty here for now!
